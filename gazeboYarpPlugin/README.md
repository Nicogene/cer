   **Gazebo Plugin for simulating tripod device**
   
   Requires GAZEBO_PLUGIN_ROOT env var to be set, pointing to downloaded source directory of GazeboYarpPlugins. 
   This is because robotology/GazeboYarpPlugin repo is not exporting correctly paths for include files, 
   to be fixed there or create a FindGazeboYarpPlugin.cmake
